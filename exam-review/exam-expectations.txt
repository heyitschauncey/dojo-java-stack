EXAM is emulating a take-home challenge
The exam is written as a real-life example of a potential employer giving you a timed exercise to test your knowledge.

1. take 100% of the exam time! 
ORANGE BELT = 8 hours total
RED/BLACK BELT = 5hours - 4.5 hours + 30 mins
DO NOT DROP EARLY - take breaks
👉 Ask Clarification questions

2. Don't panic!
- the only risk here is for you to find and expose a weakness to study and correct! 🙂

3. Don't watch the clock ⏳
- set alarms for mid way - last hour and last 20 mins

4. Start with what you know
- save black-belt features for the end
- HOWEVER, plan ahead. and you will need to drop your tables if you go from red to black belt features.

5. Don't start the exam until you have your environment set and ready
(boilerplate) --> *

6. Use exam instructions as a checklist and follow the yellow sticky notes
- double-check before submitting***
- don't overthink features - do only what the exam asks

7. Use the platform - 100% of the RED BELT & BLACK BELT features are IN the platform.

9. Don't go over time; submit it anyway. I will still code review it with you.
- ALWAYS submit what you have
- not submitting is automatic FAIL

10. Even if you are feeling nervous - Take the exam anyway as an assignment and finish it

12. STAY IN ZOOM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME OF THE EXAM 
- DON'T EXIT ZOOM

13. Join the lecture room so I can assign you to an exam room
9:00 - 10:00 MST

14. DO NOT ENTER a TA HELP CHANNEL in discord
